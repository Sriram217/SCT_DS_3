Decision Tree Classification

The task involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service. 

The prediction is based on demographic and behavioral data provided in a dataset, such as the Bank Marketing dataset. 

The goal is to analyze customer features like age, job, and spending patterns to train a model that can make accurate predictions about purchasing behavior. 

This project is ideal for understanding how decision trees work in machine learning and how customer data can be used for targeted marketing strategies. It requires knowledge of classification techniques and feature engineering.

The output has been finalized and uploaded with the designation of Decision Tree Output. You can verify its presence in this repository.
